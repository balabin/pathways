To reproduce this benchmark, start VMD, open Tk console, and execute the 
following commands in it:

1. Load the PSF file into VMD:

	mol load psf ionized.psf

2. Load the trajectory file inro VMD (and wait until loading completes):

	mol addfile 1bex_wt_51frames.dcd

3. Load the Pathways module into VMD:

	package require pathways

4. Run the Pathways command for generating a video of pathway dynamics:

	pathtraj -d "name CU" -a "name RU" -b "protein or resname RBU or (water and same resid as (water and within 2.5 of protein and within 2.5 of resname RBU))" -p 10

Pathways calculations should take a few minutes, depending on your CPU 
performance. After they complete, examine the files that Pathways 
generated and compare them with examples in the 'Pathways_Output' 
directory. Whereas small numerical differences are fine (different 
compilers|platforms, final precision of atom coordinates in trajectory 
files, etc), your output should be quantitatively close to the examples.
