# Pathways plugin in a nutshell
This repository includes the current version of code, documentation, and usage examples of the Pathways plugin for VMD described in the [2012 *J. Comp. Chem.* article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcc.22927). My [old Pathways page](https://people.chem.duke.edu/~ilya/Software/Pathways/docs/pathways.html) at Duke University that the article links to will no longer be updated or maintained, nor will I respond to emails to my former Duke University address. (Actually, the old page has not been updated for a while, largely because of Duke requiring to use a non-standard closed-source client for VPN access). Please contact me on Github instead, if needed.

### Documentation
The old theory|documentation page, including installation instructions, is in [README.html](README.html). To browse it, please clone the repository and open the file locally on your computer.

### Installation
Installation instructions for Linux and MacOS are included into the documentation page. Installation instructions for Windows are in [install_windows.md](install_windows.md).

### Usage examples
Directory [1bex_wt_movie](1bex_wt_movie) includes a complete example of a Pathways plugin run on an MD trajectory with generating a video animation of pathway dynamics. Example output files are included.
