# Introduction
Pathways is a VMD plugin for identifying and visualizing electron tunneling pathways in redox proteins (see https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcc.22927 for the article in J. Comput. Chem. and https://people.chem.duke.edu/~ilya/Software/Pathways/docs/pathways.html for more on theoretical background).

## Installation

Repository structure:

pathways: the Pathways plugin itself

pathcore/bin: pathcore binaries compiled for Linux (64- and 32-bit), Windows, and MacOS Sierra

pathcore/src: pathcore source code for Linux/MacOS and Windows, respectively, including compile scripts
